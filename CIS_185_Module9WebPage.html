      Digital Camera: The amature athletes buyers guide
    </h1>

    As a player aspiring to play professional baseball, it is essential to have both highlights and full-game films for recruiting. Technology has come a long way even in the last few years. GoPros were standard recording devices, the Mevo took its place, and now what I believe to be the best-of-breed streaming and Artificial Intellegence device the Trace has recently hit the market. Trace is an AI platform that identifies individual movements and automatically edits them for sharing and review. Each system comes with a 3-way AI camera, a sixteen foot base with sandbags, players sensors, and a carrying case for the entire system.  The camera and stand can be set up nearly anywhere on the pitch or a diamond to record the games. There are single and multi-team packages that allow flexibility to share equipment and costs between teams or organizations.

The Trace system edits individual highlights and sends those highlights to individuals in industry-standard formats to be shared easily on all social media platforms. There are IOS and Android apps that can be used to create additional camera angles and integrate these cameras into the Trace system using their multi-cam technology. There are additional metrics that are stored and accessible through the Trace software such as speed or max effort. The AI camera has a battery life of roughly four and a half hours of recording.

The cost for a single sport or team is $3800/year and multi-sport is $4600/year for up to three teams. These fees could be part of a travel organization's annual fees to offset the cost. Colleges, in particular Juco colleges, serve as a function of getting their athletes recruited at four year schools. It can take up to four hours to process one hour of game footage for a given coach to pull all the highlights across fifteen players in a typically given game. The Trace system stands to save nearly a 1000 working hours and will likely produce better and more timely results. Refer to the images below this system is compact and portable and an easy sell in my opinion.
